- Major refactoring of page_router() to allow for HTML and JSON output.
    New routing allows for filtering of various views by name/state
	JSON output supported for all views by appending &type=json (XML to follow)
	This is essentially a major MVC change.
- Calls into CORE by number are now abstracted away by referencing the name
    of the method rather than by magic numbers.  Numbers are from common.h in nagios 3.2.*
