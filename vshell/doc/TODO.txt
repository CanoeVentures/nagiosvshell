TODO for V Shell Nagios User interface

BUGS



MODEL/DATA



CONTROLLER

*** - need ability to filter hosts and services by contact.  Read only users who are contacts for specific hosts should onl be able to view their hosts and child services.  

-create filtered tables based on Monitoring Features on tactical overview 
- update xml viewer for all pages and insert links into pages  
##There is an xml builder built into the V-Shell, although it's not fully implemented yet.  If you pass the arguments index.php?xml=hosts you'll see what I mean.  I've only added this for some things so far, but it basically just turns an array into xml data and writes it to an xml file in the tmp directory.


VIEW

- create "problems" table for tactical overview page 
# need a table and a filter for "unhandled problems" that haven't been acknowledged.  This is in the tactical overview in core, and I think a lot of people use it.

- tactical overview - additional data about monitoring performance??
- tactical overview - filter for flapping, notification, event handlers, active checks, passive checks 
 -create basic xml stylesheet?

-add links for xml viewing where applicable

-create single function to fetch all relevant table icons for hosts and services table 

DOC

--need documentation for user authentication/viewing for apache (when using Nagios XI)
