# HTML Template

Add logged-in info and last updated to both header and footer (hidden until mobile)

Update nav HTML to use dynamic example.com/vshell2 path using the constant set in the /etc/vshell2 config file.

Add help / contact / issues section to display options page

## Future

Add status favicon?

- Add instruction to add nagios group to apache user? On CentOS 6.5 the /var/log/nagios dir went from 0755 to 0750 when the object.cache file updated. The cache file is readable, but not reachable due to directory permissions.

No working backend data exporting (XML, JSON, etc)
