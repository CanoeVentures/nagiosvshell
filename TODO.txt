# HTML Template

Add cookie for opened / closed navigation menu to save last state (helpful for page refreshes)

Add cookie per-table on how many to view.

Change show table values to 10 25 ALL for small tables. Remove table search functionality.

Update nav HTML to use dynamic example.com/vshell2 path using the constant set in the /etc/vshell2 config file.

## Future

Add status favicon?

- Add instruction to add nagios group to apache user? On CentOS 6.5 the /var/log/nagios dir went from 0755 to 0750 when the object.cache file updated. The cache file is readable, but not reachable due to directory permissions.

No working backend data exporting (XML, JSON, etc)
