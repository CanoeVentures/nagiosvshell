TODO for V Shell Nagios User interface

BUGS



MODEL/DATA

-page_router() calls function to build appropriate array and then send it to the correct page for display    
- turn the data that is read from the cgi.cfg file into session data so it only has to be read once
- Eventually the "read_status" and "read_detail" need to be restructured so that it only reads the status file once and then the controller determines how the info should be processed (either for a table or a host/service details page).  This would probably be a bigger change.

CONTROLLER


-filtering functions for hosts and services (warning, OK, critical) for group pages
## same as above, just needs a filtering function for the host and services arrays, and then the array can be passed to the hosts.php or services.php pages to view a table of "all hosts with notifications disabled," or something to that effect.

-create filtered tables based on Monitoring Features on tactical overview 
- update xml viewer for all pages and insert links into pages  
##There is an xml builder built into the V-Shell, although it's not fully implemented yet.  If you pass the arguments index.php?xml=hosts you'll see what I mean.  I've only added this for some things so far, but it basically just turns an array into xml data and writes it to an xml file in the tmp directory.


VIEW

- create "problems" table for tactical overview page 
# need a table and a filter for "unhandled problems" that haven't been acknowledged.  This is in the tactical overview in core, and I think a lot of people use it.
- search ability for hosts and services 
# need to be able to filter a services table by a search string so people with 8000 services can find what they need

- tactical overview - additional data about monitoring performance??
- tactical overview - filter for flapping, notification, event handlers, active checks, passive checks 
 -create basic xml stylesheet?

-add links for xml viewing where applicable
 

DOC
